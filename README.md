**World Food Production Data Analysis**

This repository contains an analysis of global food production data, focusing on key crops such as rice, wheat, maize, tea, coffee, and various fruits. The dataset was processed and visualized using Microsoft Power BI to uncover trends and insights about agricultural production across entities (e.g., countries) and years.

The project was completed as of March, 2025, and includes a Power BI report highlighting eight key insights.

**Insights**

**The analysis provides the following eight insights based on production totals (in tonnes):**

**Sum of Rice Production:** Total rice production across all entities.

**Sum of Wheat Production:** Aggregate wheat production globally or by entity.

**Sum of Tea Production:** Total tea production, likely by region or country.

**Sum of Coffee, Green Production by Entity:** Green coffee production broken down by entity (e.g., countries).

**Sum of Wheat, Maize, and Rice Production by Year:** Combined production trends for these staple crops over time.

**Sum of Apples, Avocados, Bananas, and Oranges Production by Entity:** Total fruit production per entity.

**Sum of Maize Production by Year:** Yearly trends in maize production.

**Sum of Grapes, Apples, Bananas, and Oranges Production: Aggregated production for these fruits, possibly across entities or time.**

These insights are presented in interactive visualizations within a Power BI report.



**Data Transformation**

The raw data was processed within Power BI with the following steps:

**Data Import:** Loaded the dataset into Power BI Desktop.

**Data Cleaning:** Removed missing or inconsistent entries using Power Query.

**Type Transformation:** Adjusted column data types (e.g., production quantities to numbers) in Power Query.

**Aggregation:** Used DAX measures or Power BI visuals to calculate sums of production by crop, entity, and/or year.
